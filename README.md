# DNA-sequence-analyzer-
 A Python mini-tool for exploring DNA patterns and GC content — bridging coding and genomics.It can count nucleotide frequencies (A, T, G, C), calculate GC content, find motif positions, and visualize base composition with an easy bar chart — all from your terminal or phone (via Pydroid 3).
This mini-project was built to strengthen bioinformatics and AI-genomics coding skills, serving as a first step toward applying computational analysis to genetic research problems.
Features 
-Counts occurrences of A, T, G, and C.
-Calculates GC content (%)
-Searches for a given DNA motif
-Displays a simple bar chart of base frequencies
